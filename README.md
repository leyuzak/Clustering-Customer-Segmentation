# Clustering-Customer-Segmentation
This project aims to analyze customer behavior by segmenting them based on their Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) values. The segmentation is achieved through the application of clustering techniques like K-Means and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM). The goal is to understand customer patterns and tailor marketing strategies accordingly.
